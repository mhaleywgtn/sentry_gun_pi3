# sentry_gun_pi3
At this stage this is a placeholder for the creation of a nerf sentry gun: 18 May 2017

Just putting this here, will be a project for september/october of this year.  Have an old Nerf Vulcan and Rhino fire will look at using Raspberry pi 3 zero w potentially with esp8266 for sensor control around detecting objects, thinking of using the ESP8266 radar example and having two out ahead of the gun and potentially motion detection?
